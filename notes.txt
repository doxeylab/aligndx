How to run a database migration:

Idk why but for some reason you need to delete the old column and make a new one with a completely different name (in models.py)
docker-compose run --rm -w "/app/app/" backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m 'like a commit message'
docker-compose run --rm -w "/app/app/" backend alembic upgrade head

To run monitoring profiles:
docker-compose --profile monitoring up service

To checkout psql via commandline:
psql -d aligndx_data -U aligndx_dev
