# Test datasets for alignDx

A demo server for AlignDx is available here: aligndx.uwaterloo.ca

A test dataset containing .fastq files of five samples is available here:

* SRR13094571
* SRR13094574
* SRR13094577
* SRR7615344
* ERR7912883

Instructions:

* Download the above files
* Register / sign-in to AligDx if you have not already
* Select the "PathogenScreen pipeline" with the "Human Pathogenic Viruses" panel
* Upload the above five files
* Submit

Expected output:

* Dengue virus should be detected with the highest abundance in SRR13094571, SRR13094574, SRR13094577
* Coronavirus NL63 should be detected with the highest abundance in SRR7615344
* SARS-CoV-2 should be detected with the highest abundance in ERR7912883
