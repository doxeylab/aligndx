## Introduction

In the following github repository, you will find the codebases for 2 primary projects, which ultimately have a goal of coming together. In summary, the goal is software able to greatly increase the bridging gap between healthcare and the patient. Initially, we are aiming for diagnosticians, clinicians, and possibly researchers that have interest in simplifying sequence analysis and popular assay analysis. Eventually we seek to deliver a user experience to every person, where the aforementioned tasks are easily accessible and understood.
